## 🎯 Title Optimization

- **Include year**: Add "2024" for freshness
- **Use power words**: Amazing, Ultimate, Complete, Secret, Best

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use ALL CAPS (looks spammy)
- Make it too short (< 30 characters)
- Make it too long (> 80 characters, gets cut off)
- Clickbait without delivering
- Use excessive punctuation!!!

### Examples:

**Bad:**
```
python tutorial
```

**Good:**
```

```

**Best:**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Test Title Variations
Before publishing, use the predictor to test 3-5 title variations. Pick the highest-scoring one.

### 2. Schedule for Peak Times
Use YouTube's scheduling feature to publish during optimal times, even if you're not available.

### 3. First 48 Hours Matter Most
YouTube's algorithm heavily weighs initial performance. Optimize everything before publishing.

### 4. Consistency > Perfection
Regular uploads with good optimization > irregular uploads with perfect optimization.

### 5. Match Audience Timezone
If your audience is global, pick the best compromise time or stagger uploads for different regions.

### 6. Weekend = Content Discovery
People browse more on weekends. Great time for new viewer acquisition.

### 7. Don't Sacrifice Quality
Optimization helps discovery, but content quality drives retention and long-term success.
